# THE-LEAD-DEVELOPER-ESSENTIALS

## INTRODUCTION
The author emphasizes  that the key to maximizing long-term career success for software developers lies in providing maximum value to their professional environment. While technical proficiency is crucial in starting positions, advancing to senior roles requires additional skills beyond technical expertise.

 Many developers, instead of investing in these skills, often resort to changing jobs frequently or entering private contracting, which, though generating micro improvements, may not lead to substantial opportunities.
 
 The authors emphasize the need for a growth mindset and advocate learning from disciplines such as psychology, management, marketing, finance, business, and economics. They identify `EMPATHY`, `INTEGRITY`, and `ECONOMICS` as the three main pillars crucial for a prosperous and fulfilling career path. The  message is that by understanding and mastering these pillars, developers can unlock significant opportunities for growth and success.

### EMPATHY 
 EMPATHY in the collaboration between businesses and developers. Despite having similar goals, a lack of understanding often leads to a mutual loss of value'. The Author suggests that by actively seeking to understand each other's incentives and challenges, both parties can create opportunities for more rewarding collaborations. Empathy is portrayed as a foundational element for building successful and mutually beneficial relationships between businesses and developers.

### INTEGRITY 
To excel in software development, it's not just about technical skills; being honest, hardworking, and a good example is crucial. Integrity forms the strong base for success, influencing both individual and team outcomes.

### Economics

Developers often underestimate their role's economic impact, thinking it's just about coding. The author highlights the broader skills—like product understanding and effective communication—that contribute to business success and higher returns.
